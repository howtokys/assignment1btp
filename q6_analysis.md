Selection sort: It is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has a O(n^2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where computer data storage is limited.

Merge sort: It is a more complex sort, but also a highly efficient one with a time complexity of O(n log n). A merge sort uses a technique called divide and conquer. The list is repeatedly divided into two until all the elements are separated individually. Pairs of elements are then compared, placed into order and combined.

Bubble sort: It is a simple sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted.

Merge Sort is the most efficient sorting algorithm when handling large datasets. Selection Sort and Bubble Sort both perform poorly with larger datasets, showing a significant increase in execution time as the list size increases. In short, Selection Sort and Bubble Sort become much slower as the list size increases, while Merge Sort stays much faster.
