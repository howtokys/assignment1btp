(7 points) Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.

#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')

The function double initialize an empty array called res then it loops thru each number of i in the range from 0 to n-1 (because range exclude n).
For each i, it appends i * 2 to the list res. Then it return res.
Then the for loop print each element in res, in this specific example it's 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
The output is:
0 : 2 : 4 : 6 : 8 :

#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')

It loops through the range(5) and get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and for each n, it computes n * 2 and stores the result in a new list.
The list comprehension creates the list [0, 2, 4, 6, 8].
The for loop then prints each value from this list.
The output is the same as as approach 1

#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')

The function doubleG loops through the numbers 0 to n-1 and for each i, it yields (return) i * 2 one at a time without creating a list.
The yield make a value for each iteration, but it doesn't store all the values in memory at once.
The for loop then retrieves and prints each value yielded by the generator.

(3 points) What type of function is doubleG(n)? What is the advantage of using such a function?

After a bit of googling, it's a gnerator function because of the yield keyword. One huge advantage is memory efficiency because it doesn't store all the elements in memory at once but rather it computes values right then and there and yields them one at a time. Another advantage is performance. Since it doesnâ€™t require creating and storing a full list in memory, it can improve performance when working with large sequences.
